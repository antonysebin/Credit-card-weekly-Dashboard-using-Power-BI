Project Title: Comprehensive Credit Card Weekly Dashboard 



Project Overview:

In this project, I developed a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard using transaction and customer data from a PostgreSQL database. The primary objective was to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics (KPIs) and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively. The dashboard not only supports data-driven decision-making but also highlights actionable insights based on the findings.



Key Features:

Real-time Data Extraction and Integration:

Extracted and integrated transaction and customer data from a PostgreSQL database to ensure real-time insights.

Utilized SQL queries to fetch relevant data and merged datasets for comprehensive analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted statistical exploration to gain a deep understanding of the datasets.

Power BI Dashboard Development:

Imported the  data into Power BI for  data visualization.

Designed an intuitive and interactive dashboard layout featuring key metrics such as total transaction amount, number of transactions, average transaction amount, and customer segmentation analysis.

Incorporated dynamic filters and slicers for flexible data exploration.

Actionable Insights and Reporting:

Generated detailed reports and annotations to highlight key findings and actionable insights.



Technologies Used:

PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.

Power BI for data cleaning, dashboard creation and visualization.



Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effective use of data analytics and visualization to enhance credit card operations monitoring. By leveraging  data and providing actionable insights.
